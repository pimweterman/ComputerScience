# ComputerScience

# General info
This project implements a duplicate detection method using a clustering algorithm and data cleaning

# Set-up instructions:
* Set-up the virtual environment using Python 3.9
* Open new environment
* Navigate to the file containing all the repository code by running: $ cd file_path
* Install the required packages by running: $ pip install -r requirements.txt
* Install English spaCy package by running following command: $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
* Open the code and edit (We used PyCharm IDE)

# What is included?
* ComputerScience.py: Module that includes LSH and computation of signature matrix
* HelpFunctions.py: Module that contains computational help functions (such as getting prime numbers)
* main.py: Module containing the main environment. This is where you run the code
* Data: folder containing two datasets. (cleaned and not-cleaned data)
* Results: folder containing the raw results

# How to run?
* Run the main method in the main.py module
* Please note that the running times may be long
